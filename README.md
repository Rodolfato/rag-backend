For a RAG backend with FastAPI, it's important to have a clear and maintainable folder structure that separates concerns like routing, business logic, vector database management, and interaction with the LLM model. Here's a suggested folder structure for your project:

rag-backend/
│
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py                  # FastAPI entry point
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── routes.py             # API routes
│   │   ├── models.py             # Pydantic models for requests/responses
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── vector_db_service.py  # Interaction with vector database
│   │   ├── llm_service.py        # Interaction with LLM model
│   ├── utils/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── embedding_utils.py    # Utilities for text chunking/embedding

│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── test_rag_service.py       # Unit tests for RAG service
│   ├── test_routes.py            # Unit tests for API routes
│
├── requirements.txt              # Python dependencies
├── README.md
├── .env                          # Environment variables (e.g., secrets, db paths)
├── Dockerfile                    # For containerization
├── docker-compose.yml            # For multi-container setup (optional)
└── .gitignore

Key Components:

main.py: Starts the FastAPI server and loads routes.

api/: Contains API route definitions (routes.py) and Pydantic models (models.py) for request/response validation.

services/: Houses core business logic like handling document embeddings, querying the vector database, and interacting with the LLM.

utils/: Helper functions, like embedding or database utilities, that are reused across different modules.

config.py: Central place for managing configuration settings.

tests/: Unit tests for various parts of your application, ensuring code quality and stability.

Docker/CI: Docker and docker-compose files for containerization and deployment.

This structure provides a clean separation of responsibilities and makes it easier to scale the project over time.
